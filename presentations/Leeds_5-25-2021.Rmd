# Introduction

--

**Background**

--

- Significant political polarization in US

--

- Major disagreement over the role of government in providing for those in need

--

- Pandemic policies affect employment rates, increasing reliance on social safety net

--

- Extent of social safety net may affect support for pandemic mitigation strategies 

---

# Introduction

--

**Research question**: 

How does national social safety net affect support for local pandemic policies?

--

**Method**: 

Choice experiment with randomized pandemic scenarios and policies

--

**Significance**: 

Political polarization has no end in sight. The next pandemic may be just around the corner.

---

# Stated choice experiment
  
--

- Before the consent page...

  - Basic demographic screening information, including zip codes
  - Qualtrics passively collects device type, date and time
  - Can link location with local pandemic history

--

- Survey instrument

  - Short update on county and national covid conditions
  - Description of choice task
  - Referendum-style vote on hypothetical pandemic policies
  
--

- 993 participants from Washington, Oregon and California, collected Jan 13 - Feb 16, 2021
  
--

- Policies described in terms of:

  - Context: duration and federal safety net
  - Reduction in cases, deaths
  - Restrictions on 10 categories of businesses/activities
  - Increased unemployment and resulting loss in income

# Instructions to respondents

--

Respondents did not get to vote on Federal UI payments:

> **Assume that any Federal unemployment benefits, as described, will be in place regardless of any pandemic rules that apply in [respondent's] County.**

--

We emphasized that costs/unemployment would be uncertain, unequal, and related:

> These “Average $/month lost” because of a policy are mostly a RESULT of unemployment and lost business
earnings. They are not an extra cost on top of that.

> Before a policy is adopted, we don't know exactly who will bear costs that are higher or lower than the
average. **Your own household's actual cost per month will be uncertain.**

# Conclusion

- National policy context shapes local policy preferences

- Model has much better fit with Federal UI interactions

- Some folks care about the cost consequences; liberals want a policy regardless of the economic effects

Methodological stuff:

- Designed survey questions for population of 50,000 and dynamically adjusted figures for respondent's county

- Pop-ups to reduce cognitive burden

- Ad hoc (non-FIML) selection procedure for conditional logit
  - Simulates preference parameters for participant with mean response propensity from an invitee population that was represenative on observables
