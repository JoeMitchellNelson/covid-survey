# Research questions

--

- What kind of trade-offs are people willing to make between

--

  - Illness and lost lives
  
--

  - Reduced access to activities and businesses
  - Reduced employment and income
  
--

- What are the important sources of preference heterogeneity?

# Stated choice experiment
  
--

- Survey instrument

--

  - Short update on county and national covid conditions
  
--

  - Description of choice task

--

  - Referendum-style vote on hypothetical pandemic policies
  
--

- Policies described in terms of:

  - Duration

  - Reduction in cases
  
  - Reduction in deaths
  
  - Restrictions on 10 categories of businesses/activities
  
  - Increased unemployment and resulting loss in income

--

- 1,029 participants from Washington, Oregon and California, collected Jan 13 - Feb 16

# Model

Individual $i$ chooses alternative (policy) $j \in \{A,N\}$, each with attributes (cases, deaths, restrictions, costs) $k \in 1,...,K$ such that


$V_{ij} = max\{V_{iA},V_{iN}\}$

where

$V_{ij} = \beta_1 \text{deaths}_{jk} + \beta_2\text{cases}_{jk} + \beta_3\text{cost}_{jk} + \sum_{k=4}^{13} \beta_k \text{restriction}_{jk} + \beta_NI_{j=N} + \eta_{ij}$

--

If $i$ chooses $A$, then we know:

$V_{iA} - V_{iN} = \Delta X_{AN}'\beta + \eta_{iA} - \eta_{iN} > 0$ 


If $\eta_{ij}$ is distributed Type I extreme value, then $(\eta_{iA} - \eta_{iN})$ has a logistic distribution, so we use conditional logit to estimate the parameters in the indirect utility function.

# A note on sampling

--

- Our sample is stratified to be representative in terms of age, race, gender and income

--

- Individuals are weighted so that sample is representative in terms of state of residence

--

- Demographic and location data on non-respondents permits selection correction

# Trade offs

In a county with a population of 50,000...

--

For conservatives:

- A life is worth about 63 jobs (lives vs. livelihoods)

- Keeping church fully open is worth about 15 lives

--

For liberals:

- Keeping parks  open is worth about 2 lives

- Keeping theaters and arts spaces open is worth about 1.5 lives

--

For moderates:

- Keeping gyms open is worth about 125 cases

---

# Other results

- You've had covid -> *less* concerned with cases

--

- Friend/family had covid -> nothing

--

- You *or* friend/family has comorbidities -> more concerned with cases


---

# Other dimensions 

- Federal unemployment insurance

- Household members by age group

- Race/ethnicity, gender

- Rural/urban, state effects

- Income (household/county)

- Subjective perception of $R_0$

- Housing tenure and duration

- Employment status

---

# Conclusion

--

- Research innovations: 

  - County-level public policies, rather than private choices
  - Multiple categories of benefits and costs
  - Digestible visual display of complex policy attributes
  - Personalizing choice scenarios by county characteristics
  - Correcting consumer panel for selection on unobservables
  - (Delivering tailored, randomized designs anonymously)

--

- Substantive results concerning pandemic policies:

  - Covid-19 probably not last pandemic
  - It's more than just lives vs. livelihoods
  - Which tradeoffs matter to different constituencies
  - Which cost measures are most salient ($, unemployment, and restrictions)
  - Which benefit measures are most salient (avoided cases, avoided premature death)
