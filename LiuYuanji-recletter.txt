Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to recommend Yuanji Liu for admission to your Master’s program.
I am a Ph.D. candidate and graduate instructor at the University of Oregon. Yuanji took my Intermediate Microeconomic Theory course in summer 2019 and earned a B+. Summer courses at the University of Oregon are accelerated, lasting only four weeks. As a result, I did not get to know Yuanji personally very well. However, I can attest that his performance in my course puts him in the upper quartile of the roughly 600 undergraduate students I have taught.
Given my information set, I believe Yuanji is likely to succeed in an Economics Master’s program.
Joe Mitchell-Nelson
